# Social Media Trend Analysis and Forecasting

This project focuses on predicting social media trends using machine learning models built in **IBM SPSS Modeler**. By analyzing engagement metrics like likes, shares, and comments, the system forecasts audience behavior to support smarter marketing, political campaigning, and business strategy.

## 📌 Project Overview

Social media platforms generate massive volumes of data that reflect public opinion and trending topics. Understanding and forecasting these trends in advance is crucial for organizations. This project uses **Predictive Market Analysis (PMA)** and models such as ARIMA, ETS, Neural Networks, and Random Forest to detect and predict future trends from historical data.

## 🔍 Objectives

- Track user engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments)
- Analyze historical social media activity
- Forecast future trends using predictive models
- Provide insights through interactive dashboards (via SPSS)

## 🧠 Models Used (Built in IBM SPSS Modeler)

- **ARIMA** – Time series forecasting for linear patterns  
- **ETS** – Exponential smoothing for trends and seasonality  
- **Neural Networks** – Captures complex non-linear patterns  
- **Random Forest** – For classification/regression based trend modeling  

These models are provided as `.str` files exported from SPSS Modeler.

> ⚠️ **Note**: You need to have **IBM SPSS Modeler** installed to open and view these `.str` files.
